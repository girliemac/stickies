IndexedDB Demo: Stickies
========

This is the full source code for my Net Magazine article.
The interactive demo is available at:
http://girliemac.github.io/stickies/

This JavaScript (in VanillaJS, yay!) source includes legacy code (IndexedDB old syntax from the deprecated specs) for slightly broader browser supports.
If you would like to view the simplified source code (without the legacy code, or CSS animations), please view:

W3C Specification page for IndexedDB is at:

Thank you,
